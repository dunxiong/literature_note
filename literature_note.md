    use the chromatic of lens to sweep the focus of the lens. at different object distance, use this new lens, one can get a 
    psf not depend on the object distance. this lens is limited on the widespectral application

   in this paper, the author present a family of asymmetric phase mask (p=exp(i2piasgn(u)(u/d)n))Q(u))for extends the depth of field. for the asymmetric
   phase masks of the order n=4,5,6, all the image suffer from low visibility. It seems that the absence of zeros values within the passband of
   the mtf is acheieved at the expense of "democratically" distributing low visibility among the images along the depth of field.
